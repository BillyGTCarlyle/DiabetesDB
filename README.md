# DiabetesDB
An Android app for logging insulin bolus amounts and their impact on blood glucose levels, and suggesting bolus amounts based on past data.

## The concept
The idea behind this app is to take a results-based approach to insulin estimation.  
Rather than using a purely theoretical approach based on insulin:carb ratios and estimated insulin sensitivity, DiabetesDB will use the user's own data to form a model.

Conveniently, this also means DiabetesDB acts as a meal diary too.

## Current build
This project has only just started, and I'm currently in the process of setting up the database for storing meal data.

## Roadmap
- Set up local database for storing user data
- Expand UI so users can log meals, with optional extra information
- Create an activity for viewing meal history
- Create UI for estimating a bolus
- Implement system for bolus estimation based on past data
